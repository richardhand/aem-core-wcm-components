## CSS

Most of the components available in this project have started employing the Block Element Modifier (BEM) notation [0] for their markup starting from version 2. This should greatly simplify the CSS rules for both the components themselves, but also for composed components, where super-components are assembled from AEM Core WCM Components.

To check if a component already uses the BEM notation head over to the `README.md` file of the component version you're interested in and check the `BEM description` section.
