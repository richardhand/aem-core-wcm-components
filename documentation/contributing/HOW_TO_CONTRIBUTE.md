# How to contribute

Thank you for choosing to contribute!

New code contributions should be made primarily using GitHub pull requests. This involves creating a fork of the project in your personal space, adding your new code in a branch and triggering a pull request.

See how to perform pull requests at https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests.

Also make sure to check our [development guidelines](Guidelines.md) before submitting your contribution.

## Issues

Filing [issues](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/aem-core-wcm-components/issues) and joining in conversations is the recommended way to provide feedback.

## Code Reviews

Reviewing others' code contributions is another great way to contribute. To do that, see the [open pull requests](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/aem-core-wcm-components/pulls). Committers will review all pull requests before accepting them as contributions.
